# StockSharp API Examples Directory

This directory contains a collection of example projects and scripts demonstrating the use of the [StockSharp API](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api.html) for developing trading applications. These examples are intended specifically for developers who are programming in C# and are looking to create comprehensive trading robots or tools that do not integrate directly with the Designer platform.

## Overview

The examples provided in this folder serve as practical guides to various aspects of the [StockSharp API](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api.html), showcasing how to leverage its capabilities to access market data, execute trades, and manage portfolios. These examples are particularly useful for users with a background in software development and an interest in financial markets.

## Contents

- **Basic API Usage**: Simple scripts demonstrating the initialization of the API, [connection to trading services](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api/connectors.html), and basic data handling.
- **Advanced Trading Algorithms**: More complex examples that implement full [trading strategies](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api/strategies.html) or algorithms using the StockSharp API.
- **Data Management**: Scripts that show how to fetch, store, and manage historical [market data](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api/market_data_storage.html) for analysis.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this directory is to provide:
- A learning resource for new programmers who are just starting with trading software development.
- A reference point for experienced developers looking to explore different features of the StockSharp API.
- Code bases that can be extended or customized for personal trading solutions.

## Usage

Each example comes with a detailed explanation of the code and instructions on how to set it up and run it. Developers are encouraged to modify and extend these examples to fit their specific trading needs and strategies.

## Important Note

Please note that the examples provided in this folder are not compatible with the Designer platform. They are intended for direct use and modification within C# projects and require a solid understanding of programming concepts and the .NET. Additionally, some examples may require adding a connector from StockSharp's private NuGet server. For more information on accessing and using this server, please visit [StockSharp's NuGet server manual](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/api/setup.html#private-nuget-server).

By exploring and utilizing these examples, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how to implement robust trading solutions using the StockSharp API, paving the way for the development of sophisticated trading robots and analytical tools.
