  This document specifies ID-to-URL mappings for external links in both conceptual and 
  auto-generated reference documentation.
  
  ResolveExternalLinksComponent
  http://www.codeplex.com/DocProject/Wiki/View.aspx?title=ResolveExternalLinksComponent
  
  Add url elements to this document to create mappings, as in the following examples.
  
  <url id="home" href="http://example.com/home.aspx" />
  <url id="contact" href="http://example.com/contact_us.aspx" />
  <url id="help" href="http://example.com/help.aspx" />
  
  Mappings are used in XML documentation comments by specifying see or seealso elements
  with xref attributes, as in the following examples.
  
  <remarks>
    <para>Visit our <see xref="home"/> page.</para>
    <para>You may <see xref="contact">contact us</see> for more information.</para>
  </remarks>
  <seealso xref="help">Online Assistance</seealso>
  
  Mappings are used in MAML topics by specifying a link element with an xref attribute, 
  as in the following examples.
  
  <section>
    <title/>
    <content>
      <para>Visit our <link xref="home"/> page.</para>
      <para>You may <link xref="contact">contact us</link> for more information.</para>
    </content>
  </section>

  - The id attribute is not case-sensitive.
  - The mappings in this file do not use a base URL by default (unless one is set on 
    the component level in the configuration file, which it's not by default).
  - Hyperlinks open in a new browser window or tab by default.
  - The default settings for these mappings may be changed by first expanding an 
    appropriate build component stack in the DocProject Properties window.  Then find 
    the "Resolve external links" component and invoke its editor.  Click the Mappings
    tab, select the appropriate mappings group from the list of mappings in the left 
    pane and then adjust the settings in the pane on the right.  You know you've 
    selected the appropriate mappings group if the File field is set to this file.
  - Additional mappings groups that are separate from this file may be added using the 
    editor (see the previous note).  For example, you can add a group that resolves 
    IDs to URLs that are stored in a relational database table.
