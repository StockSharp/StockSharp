            A <c>Diagram</c> is a <c>Control</c> that includes a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel"/>
            that holds some <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer"/>s that display <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>s such as
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/>s and <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>s.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Each <c>Diagram</c> has a number of standard objects that it uses to perform its duties.
            These objects are accessible via the following properties:
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Model"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.PartManager"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.LayoutManager"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CommandHandler"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CurrentTool"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.DefaultTool"/>,
            and various other tool properties.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Model"/> is the object that holds and describes all of the data
            for which <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>s are created and displayed.
            The purpose of the model is to recognize relationships between the data --
            in particular link relationships between nodes and group memberships between nodes.
            There are different kinds of models, such as
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2"/>,
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphModel`2"/> and
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModel`4"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The default model is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.UniversalGraphLinksModel"/>.
            You will typically want to replace it with your own specialized model.
            The default model does not have an <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.UndoManager"/> either;
            you may want to set <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.DiagramModel.HasUndoManager"/> to true.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.PartManager"/> is responsible for creating <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/>s
            corresponding to node data in the model, and for creating <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>s
            corresponding to link relationships in the model.
            It notices the insertion or deletion of node data or link data or group-memberships,
            and updates the diagram appropriately.
            It maintains collections of the existing <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Nodes"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Links"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can control the appearance of the nodes and links in the diagram by setting
            several data template properties:
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.NodeTemplate"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.GroupTemplate"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.LinkTemplate"/>.
            Also, because this is a standard <c>Control</c>, you can set its <c>Control.Template</c>
            property to a <c>ControlTemplate</c>.
            If you do not set these properties, its uses default templates to define the appearance
            of nodes, links, and of the control itself.
            If the value of a template property changes, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.PartManager"/>
            will rebuild the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>s that are affected.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can see the definitions of the standard templates
            in the Generic.XAML file that is in the docs subdirectory of the GoXam installation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The diagram also maintains the notion of selected parts.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.SelectedParts"/> property is an <c>ObservableCollection</c> of the currently
            selected <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>s.
            The primary selection is held as the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.SelectedPart"/> property.
            You can set <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.MaximumSelectionCount"/> to control how many parts may
            be selected at once.
            To select a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/> you can set its <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.IsSelected"/> property.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are many properties, named "Allow...", that control what operations the user
            may perform on the parts in the diagram.  These correspond to the same named
            properties on <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer"/> that govern the behavior for those parts in a particular layer.
            Furthermore for some of these properties there are corresponding properties on
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>, named "...able", that govern the behavior for that individual part.
            For example, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.AllowCopy"/> property corresponds to
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer.AllowCopy"/> and to the property <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Copyable"/>.
            The <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.CanCopy"/> predicate is false if any of these properties is false.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CommandHandler"/> implements various standard commands,
            such as the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.CommandHandler.Delete"/> method and the
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.CommandHandler.CanDelete"/> predicate.
            These methods are the implementation of the <c>Command</c>s listed as
            properties of the <c>Commands</c> static class.
            </para>
            <para>
            The diagram also keeps track of the mouse-down point and last mouse point,
            in model coordinates: <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.FirstMousePointInModel"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.LastMousePointInModel"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The diagram supports modular behavior for mouse events by implementing "tools".
            "Mode-less" tools are held in three lists: <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.MouseDownTools"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.MouseMoveTools"/>, and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.MouseUpTools"/>.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CurrentTool"/>, which defaults to an instance of <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.ToolManager"/>,
            searches these lists when a mouse event happens to find the first tool that can run.
            It then makes that tool the new <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CurrentTool"/>, where it can continue to
            process mouse events.
            When the tool is done, it stops itself, causing the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.DefaultTool"/>
            to become the new <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.CurrentTool"/>.
            </para>

            This creates a new group node by adding a copy of the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.CommandHandler.PrototypeGroup"/> data
            to the model, which must support the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel"/> interface.
            Each of the selected nodes for which <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.CanGroup"/> is true
            is made a member of that new group node.
            If all of the selected groupable nodes were members of a pre-existing group node,
            the new group node also becomes a member of that pre-existing group.
            The new group node becomes the only selected part.
            This also raises the <see cref="E:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.SelectionGrouped"/>.

            You can also have repeating variations of the lines by having multiple <c>Path</c>s,
            where those after the first one in each direction have the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.GridPattern.IntervalProperty"/> attached
            property to set integer values larger than one.
            The interval describes how often that path should be drawn.
            Note that the interval is an integer not a double because it is a multiple.
            So in the follow example, once every five lines there is a Gray line instead of a LightGray line --
            in other words every 10 model units the line is LightGray,
            except that every 50 model units the line is Gray.

            There are three kinds of methods defined in this class.
            There are basic data conversion methods, converting data types to and from Strings.
            There are methods that produce <c>XAttribute</c>s and <c>XElement</c>s
            containing given some data.
            There are methods that get data from <c>XAttribute</c>s and <c>XElement</c>s.
            </para>
            <para>
            The conversion method names are all prefixed with "To".
            They use the <c>XmlConvert</c> methods for achieving their results.
            For the basic data types (String, bool, int, Guid, and double), the conversion
            methods are the same as the equivalent <c>XmlConvert</c> methods.
            For the additional data types (Point, Size, Rect, Thickness)
            the conversion methods assume the numbers are separated by spaces.

            When generating XML using Linq for XML you will often want to avoid
            generating attributes or elements when the values are the same as the property defaults.
            To help with that situation the methods named "Attribute"
            take the attribute name, a property value, and the property's default value.
            If the value is null or if the value is equal to the default value,
            the method returns null; otherwise it returns a new <c>XAttribute</c>.
            This is convenient when building an <c>XElement</c>.
            </para>
            <para>

            where the expected attribute or child element is not present
            or where the value is in the wrong format or for some other reason
            cannot be converted to the expected data type.
            To help with these cases the methods named "Read"
            take the attribute name, the <c>XElement</c> on which the attribute may exist,
            and the default value for that property.
            If the <c>XElement</c> is null,
            or if it has no <c>XAttribute</c> with the given name,
            or if there is an exception converting the string value to the expected data type,
            it will return the default value.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are also generic methods for handling enumerations and for sequences of data.
            For data sequences, of type <c>IEnumerable</c>, the methods will generate
            and expect to consume child elements, one for each item.
            You will need to specify the name of those child elements,
            and the conversion function for the item data type.

             <para>
             This provides a standard implementation of
             <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2"/>
             data that represents nodes and includes a property for
             referring to the "parent" node, and a property for holding a list of
             "children" nodes.
             You can use this class if you do not already have your own application class
             holding information about nodes and if you want to inherit from an existing
             class so that you can just add your own properties.  Here's a simple example:
             </para>

                  set { if (_Name != value) { String old = _Name; _Name = value; RaisePropertyChanged("Name", old, value); } }
                }

             </code>
             </para>
             <para>
             Note that property setters need to raise the model's Changed event,
             so that the model knows about changes in the data and can then update the diagram.
             You should call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.RaisePropertyChanged(System.String,System.Object,System.Object)"/> only when the value has actually changed,
             and you should pass both the previous and the new values, in order to support undo/redo.
             </para>
             <para>
             You should override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.Clone"/> method
             if the fields contain data that should not be shared between copies.
             The properties that you define should also be serializable,
             in order for the data to be copiable, especially to and from the clipboard.
             </para>
             <para>
             If you add properties to this node data class, and if you are using the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2.Save``1(System.Xml.Linq.XName,System.Xml.Linq.XName)"/> and

             Normally, each <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.Key"/> should have a unique value within the model.
             You can maintain that yourself, by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.Key"/> to unique values
             before adding the node data to the model's collection of nodes.
             Or you can ensure this by overriding the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2.MakeNodeKeyUnique(`0)"/>
             method.  The override (or the setting of the same-named delegate in
             <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2.Delegates"/>)
             is required if nodes might be copied within the model.

             <para>
             If you want each node to keep a reference to its "parent" node,
             you can use the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.ParentKey"/> property.
             If you want each node to keep a list of reference to its "children" nodes,
             you can use the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.ChildKeys"/> property, which is a list of node keys.
             You can use both <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.ParentKey"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1.ChildKeys"/> at the same time.

             This provides a standard implementation of
             <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphModel`2"/>
             data that represents nodes and includes properties for

             and includes properties for specifying the containing subgraph node key
             and/or the collection of member node keys.
             You can use this class if you do not already have your own application class
             holding information about nodes and if you want to inherit from an existing
             class so that you can just add your own properties.  Here's a simple example:

             Note that property setters need to raise the model's Changed event,
             so that the model knows about changes in the data and can then update the diagram.
             You should call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphModelNodeData`1.RaisePropertyChanged(System.String,System.Object,System.Object)"/> only when the value has actually changed,
             and you should pass both the previous and the new values, in order to support undo/redo.

             <para>
             This provides a standard implementation of
             <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModel`4"/>
             data that represents nodes with support for subgraphs,
             including properties for specifying the containing subgraph node key
             and/or the collection of member node keys.
             You can use this class if you do not already have your own application class
             holding information about nodes and if you want to inherit from an existing
             class so that you can just add your own properties.  Here's a simple example:
             </para>
             <para>
             <code>
              [Serializable]
              public class MyData : GraphLinksModelNodeData&lt;String&gt; {
                public MyData() { }
            
                public String Color {
                  get { return _Color; }
                  set { if (_Color != value) { String old = _Color; _Color = value; RaisePropertyChanged("Color", old, value); } }
                }
                private String _Color = "White";
            
                public String Name {
                  get { return _Name; }
                  set { if (_Name != value) { String old = _Name; _Name = value; RaisePropertyChanged("Name", old, value); } }
                }
                private String _Name;
            
                public String Address {
                  get { return _Address; }
                  set { if (_Address != value) { String old = _Address; _Address = value; RaisePropertyChanged("Address", old, value); } }
                }
                private String _Address;
              }
             </code>
             Then you can bind to these data properties in the <c>DataTemplate</c> for your nodes:
             <code>
             &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="NodeTemplate"&gt;
               &lt;Border BorderBrush="Black" BorderThickness="1" CornerRadius="5" Padding="5"
                       Background="{Binding Path=Data.Color, Converter={StaticResource theColorConverter}}"
                       go:Node.Location="{Binding Path=Data.Location, Mode=TwoWay}"&gt;
                 &lt;StackPanel&gt;
                   &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Name}" HorizontalAlignment="Left" /&gt;
                   &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Address}" HorizontalAlignment="Left" /&gt;
                 &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
               &lt;/Border&gt;
             &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
             </code>
             </para>
             <para>
             Note that property setters need to raise the model's Changed event,
             so that the model knows about changes in the data and can then update the diagram.
             You should call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModelNodeData`1.RaisePropertyChanged(System.String,System.Object,System.Object)"/> only when the value has actually changed,
             and you should pass both the previous and the new values, in order to support undo/redo.
             </para>
             <para>
             You should override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModelNodeData`1.Clone"/> method
             if the fields contain data that should not be shared between copies.
             The properties that you define should also be serializable,
             in order for the data to be copiable, especially to and from the clipboard.

            <typeparam name="NodeKey">the Type of a value uniquely identifying a node data in the model</typeparam>
            <typeparam name="PortKey">the Type of an optional value that helps distinguish different "ports" on a node</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This provides a standard implementation of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModel`4"/>
            data that represents links,
            including properties that are "references" to the two nodes at each end
            of the link and optional "port" parameter information at both ends.
            You can use this class if you do not already have your own application class
            holding information about links and if you want to inherit from an existing
            class so that you can just add your own properties.  Here's a simple example:
            </para>
            <para>
            <code>
             [Serializable]
             public class MyLinkData : GraphLinksModelLinkData&lt;String, String&gt; {
               public double Cost {
                 get { return _Cost; }
                 set { if (_Cost != value) { double old = _Cost; _Cost = value; RaisePropertyChanged("Cost", old, value); } }
               }
               private double _Cost;
             }
            </code>
            This associates a number with each link so that you can bind values to this property in a <c>DataTemplate</c>.
            For example, look at the <c>TextBlock</c>'s binding of <c>Text</c> in this template:
            <code>
            &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="LinkTemplate"&gt;
              &lt;go:LinkPanel go:Part.SelectionElementName="Path" go:Part.SelectionAdorned="True"&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkShape x:Name="Path" go:LinkPanel.IsLinkShape="True" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" /&gt;
                &lt;Path Fill="Black" go:LinkPanel.ToArrow="Standard" /&gt;
                &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Cost}" /&gt;
              &lt;/go:LinkPanel&gt;
            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that property setters need to raise the model's Changed event,
            so that the model knows about changes in the data and can then update the diagram.
            You should call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModelLinkData`2.RaisePropertyChanged(System.String,System.Object,System.Object)"/> only when the value has actually changed,
            and you should pass both the previous and the new values, in order to support undo/redo.
            </para>
            <para>
            The properties that you define should also be serializable,
            in order for the data to be copiable, especially to and from the clipboard.
            You should override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphLinksModelLinkData`2.Clone"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            In the sample above,
            the <typeparamref name="NodeKey"/> is declared to be a string,
            which is used as the way to uniquely refer to node data.
            The <typeparamref name="PortKey"/> is declared to be a string,
            which is useful if you want to distinguish between multiple "ports" on a single node.
            However, if your nodes only have a single port, you can ignore the port
            parameter information, and the <typeparamref name="PortKey"/> type does not really matter,
            although <c>string</c> is recommended for compatibility with the implementation of <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/>
            methods that deal with ports.
            </para>
            <para>
            This class is not useful with <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.GraphModel`2"/> or <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModel`2"/>.

            All diagram models implement this interface or an interface that inherits from this interface.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            This is reponsible for defining relationships between nodes, involving links and grouping.
            It does not know about any <c>FrameworkElement</c>s
            (including <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/> or <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel"/> or <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>).
            It just knows about .NET CLR objects as data of type <see cref="T:System.Object"/> or about more specific types
            when instantiating one of the generic <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.DiagramModel"/> classes.
            It is vaguely analogous to a <c>CollectionView</c>, providing additional organization of the source data.
            It defines a graph from the data instead of imposing a total ordering on it and filtering/sorting/grouping it.
            It also supports two-pass copying of existing data and undo/redo support via an <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.UndoManager"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are four categories of members in this interface: updating, navigation, modification, and miscellaneous.
            The updating methods need to be called when there has been a change to the data,
            so that the model can be kept up-to-date with the data.
            The navigation methods support examining the diagram and traversing the graph defined
            by the nodes and links in the diagram.
            The modification methods are used to alter the diagram.
            The miscellaneous methods and properties include support for model change notification,
            for undo/redo, for edits, and for data transfer.
            Additional categories of members exist in each of the model classes.
            </para>
            <para>
            The most important member of this interface is the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.NodesSource"/> property,
            the collection of node data defining the graph.
            You will need to set it before anything can be seen in your <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/>.
            The model will look at each node data in that collection to discover the
            relationships that will form the graph.
            The methods and properties for discovering a graph from the data depend on
            the kind of model, so they are not part of this interface.
            </para>
            <para>
            As data is added or removed from the model, or as data is modified, the graph implied
            by the data changes.  Whenever the data is modified, the model must be notified.
            The model interfaces (both this interface and more specific interfaces inheriting
            from this interface) have a category of methods for being notified of data changes.
            This basic interface includes methods such as <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeAdded(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeRemoved(System.Object)"/>, and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeKeyChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            More specific kinds of models have additional methods, such as:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.DoParentNodeChanged(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IConnectedModel.DoToNodeKeyRemoved(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.DoLinkAdded(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.DoMemberNodeKeysChanged(System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel.DoGroupNodeChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            Updating methods have names that start with "Do".
            </para>
            <para>
            Of course if your data is unchanging, neither by application code nor by
            the user, you will not need to be concerned about keeping the model up-to-date.
            But if your data might change, .NET provides some standard interfaces for change
            notification that you should use if you want successful data binding.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <c>INotifyPropertyChanged</c> interface (in the
            <c>System.ComponentModel</c> namespace) is commonly used for
            notification of property changes.  The diagram model classes automatically
            register themselves as <c>INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged</c> event
            listeners for each of the data objects that are in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.NodesSource"/>
            collection so that they can be updated if a model-relevant property changes
            in a data object.
            We suggest that you have your node data class implement this interface,
            but that you use the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ModelChangedEventArgs"/> class for event arguments
            instead of <c>PropertyChangedEventArgs</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            In addition, Microsoft recommends implementing the  <c>INotifyCollectionChanged</c>
            interface (in the <c>System.Collections.Specialized</c> namespace) for providing
            change notification of collection objects.
            .NET offers the <c>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</c> class as a standard
            collection that implements <c>INotifyCollectionChanged</c>.
            So if the collection you supply as the value of <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.NodesSource"/> implements
            this interface, the model will automatically call the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeAdded(System.Object)"/>
            and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeRemoved(System.Object)"/> methods for you.
            Similarly, for the data properties that are expected to be collections,
            (such as the collection of tree children nodes for a data node in the tree model),
            we suggest you use <c>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</c>.
            Note that the optional data classes that we provide for your use, if you do not already
            have your own data classes, implement <c>INotifyPropertyChanged</c> and make use
            of <c>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</c>.
            An example is <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.TreeModelNodeData`1"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The generic model classes have a parameterized type, <c>NodeType</c>,
            that denotes the type of the node data that it contains.
            That of course is the required type of each item in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.NodesSource"/> collection.
            Furthermore, all of the methods that operate on node data take and/or return that type.
            This design provides for better type checking at compile time and potentially
            better performance at run time.
            </para>
            <para>
            But <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/> and its subinterfaces are not generic.
            Their methods all take and/or return data of type <c>Object</c> instead of a
            parameterized type.
            This "universality" is necessary because the diagram control is not a generic class.
            </para>
            <para>
            Unlike most controls that bind to a list of items, diagrams involve relationships
            between the items that are much more general than just the order in the list.
            This is achieved by interpreting some property values as "references" to other data.
            Such references might be implemented as .NET CLR references (i.e. pointers).
            However, it is also common to use other values, such as strings or numbers,
            as the references.  Such a scheme requires being able to identify each data
            object with a unique value.
            </para>
            <para>
            The generic model class have another parameterized type, <c>NodeKey</c>,
            that denotes the type of the values that refer to node data.
            When the abstract references are actually .NET CLR references, the <c>NodeKey</c>
            type will be the same as the <c>NodeType</c> type.
            But more often the <c>NodeKey</c> will be something like <c>String</c>
            or <c>int</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Normally the expectation is that the key value for each node data does not change.
            However, the models do support such a circumstance -- make sure the
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.DoNodeKeyChanged(System.Object)"/> method is called right after changing a node's key.

            <para>
            The <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.FindNodeByKey(System.Object)"/> method is useful for finding a node data given its key.
            To find out if a node data is in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.NodesSource"/> collection, call the
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsNodeData(System.Object)"/> predicate.
            </para>
            <para>
            The models have a number of methods that are useful for examining or navigating.
            These method names tend to start with "Get" or "Is".
            For "link" relationships, the following methods apply to all models:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinked(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetFromNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetToNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetConnectedNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>.
            Particular kinds of models have additional methods for traversing graphs, such as:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.GetChildrenForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLinksBetweenNodes(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetToNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLabelNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.GetMemberNodesForGroup(System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel.GetGroupForNode(System.Object)"/>.
            Note that the models will have similar protected (not public)
            methods that actually implement the corresponding behavior on the data.
            There will be virtual so that your model implementation can customize
            or optimize how the method performs the operation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The models also have methods for modifying.
            These method names start with "Modify", "Add", or "Remove".
            For nodes, there are <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNode(System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveNode(System.Object)"/>.
            For links, there are <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddLink(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveLink(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            Furthermore, particular kinds of models have additional methods for
            changing relationships, such as:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.AddChildNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IConnectedModel.AddFromNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.SetLinkLabel(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.RemoveMemberNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel.SetGroupNode(System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            Note that the models will have similar protected (not public)
            methods that actually implement the corresponding behavior on the data.
            There will be virtual so that your model implementation can customize
            or optimize how the method performs the modification.
            </para>
            <para>
            Finally, there is the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.Modifiable"/> property, that should
            disable user actions that would modify the model, and that causes
            errors when you call a model-modifying method anyway.
            </para>
            <para>
            Models support a two-pass copying process.
            A single pass copy is insufficient because some "references"
            cannot be made before all objects have been copied -- those references
            need to be fixed-up afterwards, in a second pass.
            Let's say that we have two objects to be copied, A and B, and that
            A has a string property that refers to B by its name, "B".
            After making the two copied objects, A2 and B2, A2's reference
            will typically still be "B".  The second copy pass will operate
            on A2 and give it a chance to look for the original "B" data,
            to find the copied B2 data, and to change A2's reference to be "B2".
            </para>
            <para>
            The principal copying method is <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddCollectionCopy(Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDataCollection,Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ICopyDictionary)"/>.
            This first makes copies of all the data to be copied, and then
            iterates over them again, fixing up the references.
            You may need to override protected virtual methods whose names
            start with "Copy" in order to correctly construct copies of your data
            in the first pass, and in order to correctly fix references to other
            data in the second pass.
            </para>
            <para>
            Even after the two-pass copying process has finished, there may still
            be unresolved references.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.ClearUnresolvedReferences"/>
            </para>
            <para>
            For convenience in making a copy of a node and adding it to the model,
            there is also the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNodeCopy(System.Object)"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Depending on the application, not all relationships should be possible.
            Models provide support for link relationships with the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/> method.
            There are more specific model predicates for <c>IsRelinkValid</c>:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.IsRelinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IConnectedModel.IsRelinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.IsRelinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.IsMemberValid(System.Object,System.Object)"/> offers similar support for the
            group-member relationship in <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel"/>.
            The diagram control uses these methods for deciding which user actions
            are permissible.
            The model classes add support for customizing these methods.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each model is not only a consumer of events on its data but is also a generator
            <see cref="E:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.Changed"/> events, to allow model consumers such as the diagram control
            to keep themselves up-to-date with the model.
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ModelChange"/> is an enumeration that lists all of the kinds of changes
            that can happen to the predefined model classes.
            Whenever there is a change to a model, the code calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RaiseChanged(Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ModelChangedEventArgs)"/>
            or a similar method to notify model consumers.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsModified"/> property is automatically set to true as
            <see cref="E:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.Changed"/> events are raised.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each model also supports undo and redo, using an
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.UndoManager"/> that records
            <see cref="E:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.Changed"/> events.
            Because <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ModelChangedEventArgs"/> also implements <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IUndoableEdit"/>,
            it is very easy for the undo manager to remember the changes in a manner that makes
            them easy to undo or redo.
            But note that the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.UndoManager"/> property is initially null;
            you will need to set this property before any actions can be recorded
            and then undone.
            When you want to make transient changes that you do not want to be recorded
            by the undo manager, you can temporarily set <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.SkipsUndoManager"/>
            to true.
            </para>
            <para>
            As you add state to your data or to your model, you may need to add code
            that implements state changing as needed for undo and redo.  This can be done
            either by overriding a model method or a data method if the data implements
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IChangeDataValue"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            A single user gesture or command may result in many model/data changes.
            These all want to be treated as a single undo-able action.
            You can group such changes together by calling
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.StartTransaction(System.String)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.CommitTransaction(System.String)"/>.
            If after a <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.StartTransaction(System.String)"/> you don't want to commit the
            changes, you can call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RollbackTransaction"/>, which not only
            ends the transaction but also automatically "undoes" all of the changes
            since the call to <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.StartTransaction(System.String)"/>.

            If you need to model multiple links between nodes, use the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel"/>.

            <para>
            There are three categories of methods: updating, navigation, and modification.
            </para>
            <para>
            The updating methods need to be called when there has been a change to the data,
            so that the model can be kept up-to-date.
            These methods include changes to the "parent" node key:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.DoParentNodeChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            These methods also include changes to the collection of "children" node keys:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.DoChildNodeKeyAdded(System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.DoChildNodeKeyRemoved(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.DoChildNodeKeysChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The navigation methods support examining and traversing the graph.
            Some of these methods are actually defined in the base interface, <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/>.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.FindNodeByKey(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinked(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetConnectedNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            But this interface adds a few more methods:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.GetParentForNode(System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.GetChildrenForNode(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The modification methods are used to alter the graph.
            A number of these methods are defined in <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/>, such as 
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveNode(System.Object)"/>,

            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddCollectionCopy(Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDataCollection,Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ICopyDictionary)"/>.
            But this interface adds several methods.
            For the "parent" node keys:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel.SetParentNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            For the collection of "children" node keys:

            </para>
            <para>
            Note that this interface is universal, because it can only assume the node data is of type <see cref="T:System.Object"/>.
            The corresponding methods in the generic model classes operate on and return a specific node data type.

            <summary>
            A model that supports directed link relationships between nodes,
            with the relationship information stored in separate link data structures.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Link relationship information is found in link data held in the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.LinksSource"/> collection property.
            If you want a simpler model where the link relationship information is
            stored in a list on each node data, use the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IConnectedModel"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            This model can support any number of links between any pair of nodes.
            Furthermore, this model supports additional information at each end of
            the link, to distinguish between different "ports" on each node.
            </para>
            <para>
            Links are nominally directional, each "coming from a node" and "going to a node".
            However, if you want to model undirected relationships, you can use the methods that
            ignore the direction of the links.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are three categories of methods: updating, navigation, and modification.
            </para>
            <para>
            The updating methods need to be called when there has been a change to the data,
            so that the model can be kept up-to-date.
            These methods include changes to the collection of link data:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.DoLinkAdded(System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.DoLinkRemoved(System.Object)"/>.
            They also include methods involving changes to the state of the link data:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.DoLinkPortsChanged(System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.DoLinkLabelChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The navigation methods support examining and traversing the graph.
            Some methods working on node data are actually defined in the base interface, <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/>.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.FindNodeByKey(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinked(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetFromNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetToNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.GetConnectedNodesForNode(System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.IsLinkValid(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            But this interface adds a number of methods that also work on node data:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.IsLinkData(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLinksForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLinksForNode(System.Object,System.Predicate{System.Object})"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetFromLinksForNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetToLinksForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLinksBetweenNodes(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            And there are methods that work on link data:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetFromNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetFromParameterForLink(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetToNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetToParameterForLink(System.Object)"/>.
            And there are methods that involve a link data that has a node data as a "label":
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetHasLabelNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetHasLabeledLinkForNode(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLabelNodeForLink(System.Object)"/>, and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.GetLabeledLinkForNode(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The modification methods are used to alter the graph.
            A number of these methods working on node data are defined in <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/>, such as 
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveNode(System.Object)"/>, 
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddLink(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveLink(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddCollectionCopy(Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDataCollection,Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ICopyDictionary)"/>.
            But this interface adds several methods working on link data:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.AddLink(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.RemoveLink(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.AddLinkCopy(System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.SetLinkFromPort(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.SetLinkToPort(System.Object,System.Object,System.Object)"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel.SetLinkLabel(System.Object,System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that this interface is universal, because it can only assume the node data is of type <see cref="T:System.Object"/>.
            The corresponding methods in the generic model classes operate on and return a specific node data type.

            A model that supports a grouping relationship between nodes,
            with the relationship information stored on each node as collections of related nodes.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Each node data can be a group (i.e. a node "container") or not (i.e. an "atomic" node).
            It is assumed that a node data cannot dynamically switch between being a group or not.
            Each node data can have a list of references to "member" nodes.
            All node references are by node data key value.
            </para>
            <para>
            This kind of model assumes the grouping is implicit from these references.
            At this time we do not support a model where the grouping information is
            explicitly provided by data structures different from the node data.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are three categories of methods: updating, navigation, and modification.
            </para>
            <para>
            The updating methods need to be called when there has been a change to the data,
            so that the model can be kept up-to-date.
            These methods include changes to the collection of "member" node keys:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.DoMemberNodeKeyAdded(System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.DoMemberNodeKeyRemoved(System.Object,System.Object)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.DoMemberNodeKeysChanged(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The navigation methods support examining and traversing the graph.
            One such method is actually defined in the base interface,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.FindNodeByKey(System.Object)"/>.
            This interface adds the following methods:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.GetIsGroupForNode(System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.GetMemberNodesForGroup(System.Object)"/>,

            </para>
            <para>
            The modification methods are used to alter the graph.
            A number of these methods are defined in <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel"/>, such as 
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNode(System.Object)"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.RemoveNode(System.Object)"/>.
            But this interface adds several methods:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.AddMemberNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.RemoveMemberNodeKey(System.Object,System.Object)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IGroupsModel.SetMemberNodeKeys(System.Object,System.Collections.IEnumerable)"/>.

            This model is basically a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel"/> that automatically assigns
            links to belong to groups.  There are two methods, one to get the containing group
            for a link (if any), <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphLinksModel.GetGroupForLink(System.Object)"/>, and one to get all of the
            link data that are members of a group, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphLinksModel.GetMemberLinksForGroup(System.Object)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Because membership of links in groups is automatically computed,
            there are no modification or updating methods in this interface.

            You will need to initialize the palette's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Model"/> with the node data with which
            you wish to populate the palette.  For example, for the (simple) palette:
            <code>
              &lt;go:Palette x:Name="myPalette" NodeTemplate="..." /&gt;
            </code>
            you would need to perform something like the following at initialization:
            <code>
              myPalette.Model.NodesSource = new String[] {
                "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma"
              };
            </code>
            You also need to set <c>AllowDrop="True"</c> on the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/>(s)
            into which users may drop the items from the palette.
            </para>
            <para>
            It is commonplace to have a different and probably simpler node <c>DataTemplate</c> for

            <para>
            By default a palette uses a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.GridLayout"/>
            as its <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.Layout"/>.  That <c>GridLayout</c> defaults to sorting
            all of the nodes by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Text"/> (attached) property.
            It also re-layouts automatically whenever the viewport size changes,
            because the size of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel"/> changes or because the scale changes.
            </para>
            <para>
            The default style for a palette also makes it <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.IsReadOnly"/>,
            and sets <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.AllowDragOut"/> to be true, to permit drag-and-drop

            You can explicitly re-layout the whole diagram by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.LayoutDiagram"/>.
            However, it is more common to let this <c>LayoutManager</c> decide when layouts should happen.
            You can control this by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.DiagramLayout.Conditions"/> property
            on each kind of layout.
            By default each layout has its <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.DiagramLayout.Conditions"/> set to invalidate
            its layout whenever a node or a link or a group membership is added or removed, but
            not when a node changes size.
            Once a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.DiagramLayout"/> has been invalidated, this <c>LayoutManager</c>
            will eventually call its <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.IDiagramLayout.DoLayout(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{Northwoods.GoXam.Node},System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{Northwoods.GoXam.Link})"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/> and <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/> has a single <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.IDiagramLayout"/> that
            may position the node and route the link.  The <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.IDiagramLayout"/> is found by
            proceeding up the chain of containing <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Group"/>s until it finds one with a value
            for <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Group.Layout"/>, or it ultimately uses the diagram's

            out by a given layout.  You can set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.LayoutId"/> attached property to
            be the string "None" if you do not want it to be laid out.

            If you want to customize the standard behavior, you can easily override any of its methods
            and substitute an instance of your custom layout manager class for your diagram.
            <code>
            public class CustomLayoutManager : LayoutManager {
              protected override bool CanLayoutPart(Part p, IDiagramLayout lay) {
                return ...;  // decide dynamically which Nodes and Links should be considered for each layout
              }
            }
            </code>
            and install it with either XAML:
            <code>
              &lt;go:Diagram ...&gt;
                &lt;go:Diagram.LayoutManager&gt;
                  &lt;local:CustomLayoutManager /&gt;

              &lt;/go:Diagram&gt;
            </code>
            or in the initialization of your Diagram control:
            <code>
              myDiagram.LayoutManager = new CustomLayoutManager();
            </code>

            Automatic layout in GoXam includes support for animated movement of
            nodes to their intended destinations.
            Such support is not limited to the execution of <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.PerformLayout"/> --
            you can call <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.MoveAnimated(Northwoods.GoXam.Node,System.Windows.Point)"/> at any time.
            For example, the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/> method <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Move(System.Windows.Point,System.Boolean)"/> calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.MoveAnimated(Northwoods.GoXam.Node,System.Windows.Point)"/>.

            Set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.AnimationTime"/> property to control how quickly
            the animation completes.
            For nodes that do not have an initial location (because the value is <c>NaN,NaN</c>),
            you can specify the point from where they appear to come
            by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.LayoutManager.DefaultLocation"/>.

            For compatibility with older behavior,
            this does not examine the graph structure, but only at the positions of the nodes.
            By default this looks at the first few nodes in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.ForceDirectedLayout.Network"/>.
            If several of their <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.GenericNetwork`3.Vertex.Bounds"/> intersect,

            <value>
            A value of zero (the default) means there is no limit;

            <para>
            This property is just a suggested constraint on how
            broadly the tree will be laid out.
            When there isn't enough breadth for all of the children of a node,
            the children are placed in as many rows as needed to try to stay
            within the given breadth limit.
            If the value is too small, since this layout algorithm
            does not modify the size or shape of any node, the nodes will
            just be laid out in a line, one per row, and the breadth is
            determined by the broadest node.
            The distance between rows is specified by <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.TreeLayout.RowSpacing"/>.
            To make room for the links that go around earlier rows to get to
            later rows, when the alignment is not a "center" alignment, the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.TreeLayout.RowIndent"/> property specifies that space at the
            start of each row.

            Having a positive value is useful if you want to reserve space
            at the start of the row of children for some reason.
            For example, if you want to pretend the parent node is infinitely deep,
            you can set this to be the breadth of the parent node.

            <para>
            This property is just a suggested constraint on how
            broadly the tree will be laid out.
            When there isn't enough breadth for all of the children of a node,
            the children are placed in as many rows as needed to try to stay
            within the given breadth limit.
            If the value is too small, since this layout algorithm
            does not modify the size or shape of any node, the nodes will
            just be laid out in a line, one per row, and the breadth is
            determined by the broadest node.
            The distance between rows is specified by <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.TreeLayout.RowSpacing"/>.
            To make room for the links that go around earlier rows to get to
            later rows, when the alignment is not a "center" alignment, the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layout.TreeLayout.RowIndent"/> property specifies that space at the

            This class maintains a collection of all diagram <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PartManager.Nodes"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PartManager.Links"/>,
            as well as dictionaries mapping model data to <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/>s and <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>s.
            You can find the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/> for a model data object by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.PartManager.FindNodeForData(System.Object,Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel)"/> and

            You need to add node data to the model by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IDiagramModel.AddNode(System.Object)"/>.

            </para>
            <para>
            You can also control whether the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/>'s <c>Background</c> or
            any background <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.GridPattern"/> is printed, by setting the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.PageOptions"/> property.  By default, only the grid is printed.
            If you want to have the grid and templates fill the whole page,
            set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.PageOptions"/> property to include <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintPageOptions.Full"/>,
            for example: <c>PageOptions="FullGridBackground"</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The size on the page for the printed parts is governed by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.Scale"/> property.
            You can set that property to zero to cause it to scale everything to fit on one page.
            Otherwise the number of pages that will be printed will depend on the area to be printed
            (determined by either the parts that are printed or the specified <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.Bounds"/>)
            times the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.Scale"/>, as will fit in the size of each page minus the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.Margin"/>s.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can print decorations on each page by specifying the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.BackgroundTemplate"/> and/or the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.ForegroundTemplate"/>.
            These templates are applied to each page, data-bound to an instance of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.PageInfo"/> describing that page.
            This makes it easy to customize the header or footer.
            For example:
            <code>
            </code>
            &lt;go:Diagram . . .&gt;
              &lt;go:Diagram.PrintManager&gt;

                  &lt;go:PrintManager.BackgroundTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                      &lt;go:SpotPanel&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Text="Confidential"
                                   Foreground="LightGray" FontSize="50"

                          &lt;TextBlock.RenderTransform&gt;
                            &lt;RotateTransform Angle="-45" /&gt;
                          &lt;/TextBlock.RenderTransform&gt;
                        &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
                      &lt;/go:SpotPanel&gt;
                    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
                  &lt;/go:PrintManager.BackgroundTemplate&gt;
                &lt;/go:PrintManager&gt;
              &lt;/go:Diagram.PrintManager&gt;
            &lt;/go:Diagram&gt;
            </para>

            You can see the definition of the standard <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PrintManager.ForegroundTemplate"/>
            in the Generic.XAML file that is in the docs subdirectory of the GoXam installation.
            It includes cut marks so that you can cut off the right sides and the bottoms
            of each of the pages that are not in the last column or the last row, allowing you
            to tape the sheets together to form a visually continuous diagram.

            A spot represents a relative point from (0,0) to (1,1) within the bounds of an element, plus an absolute offset.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            A spot can represent a particular point (such as <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.TopLeft"/> or <c>new Spot(0.25, 0.25)</c>),
            or a particular side (such as <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.RightSide"/>)

            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.X"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.Y"/> values denote the fractional distance
            of the spot point along the dimensions of the element's width and height.
            Zero is at the left or the top of the element;
            one is at the right or the bottom of the element.
            The values must be between 0 and 1.
            Values that are <c>NaN</c> are reserved for special spots such as
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.None"/> or the spots that represent sides.

            and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.OffsetY"/> values are added to determine the final point.
            The offset values may be negative.
            Negative offset values when the <c>(X,Y)</c> are near the left and/or top
            may result in a point that is outside of the bounds of the element.
            Positive offset values when the <c>(X,Y)</c> are near the right and/or bottom

            This panel is useful for positioning child elements relative either to the bounds of a particular child
            or to a computed rectangle.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            The child elements of a <c>SpotPanel</c> are positioned according the values of two attached properties:
            <c>Spot</c> and <c>Alignment</c>.  Both property values are of type <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot"/>.
            Typically each child will at least specify a value for the <c>Spot</c> attached property,
            and will also specify a value for <c>Alignment</c> for minor adjustments in the position.
            </para>
            <para>
            The value of <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.GetSpot(System.Windows.DependencyObject)"/> specifies a point in a rectangle where the element should be positioned.
            The value of <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.GetAlignment(System.Windows.DependencyObject)"/> specifies what point of the element should be positioned at
            the spot point of the rectangle.
            Both properties default to <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.Center"/> -- the center of the element is centered inside
            the rectangle.
            (This panel ignores the <c>FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment</c> and <c>VerticalAlignment</c> properties.)
            </para>
            <para>
            The rectangle used for determining spot points is
            given by the bounds of the child element of the panel that has the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.MainProperty"/> set to true.
            If there is no such element, the value of <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.ComputeBorder"/> is used instead.
            By default <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.ComputeBorder"/> will return the desired size of the first child.
            However, the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.GroupPanel"/> class overrides the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.SpotPanel.ComputeBorder"/> method
            to return values unrelated to any of this panel's children.

            <para>
            Each layer can only be a child of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel"/> -- they cannot be nested.
            There are two classes inheriting from this abstract <c>Layer</c> class: <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.NodeLayer"/>
            and <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkLayer"/>, which hold only nodes or only links, respectively.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each layer has an <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer.Id"/> property that is used to identify the layer
            in the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel"/> amongst multiple layers of the same type.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are many properties, named "Allow...", that control what operations the user
            may perform on the parts held by this layer.  These correspond to the same named
            properties on <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/> that govern the behavior for all parts in all layers.
            Furthermore for some of these properties there are corresponding properties on
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/>, named "...able", that govern the behavior for that individual part.
            For example, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer.AllowCopy"/> property corresponds to
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.AllowCopy"/> and to the property
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Copyable"/>.
            The <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.CanCopy"/> predicate is false if any of
            these properties is false.

            You may not apply any transforms to a <c>Layer</c>; that is reserved to GoXam for future use.

            A <c>LinkPanel</c> is a <c>Panel</c> used to position and orient elements along

            <para>
            The simplest <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/> is implemented with a <c>DataTemplate</c> that
            consists of a <c>Shape</c> that is the stroke (a line) connecting one node with another.
            In WPF that is normally an instance of <c>LinkShape</c>;
            Such a link cannot have any arrowheads or text labels or other decorations.
            Furthermore you cannot connect any link to or from the link itself,
            nor can any link labels be selectable or manipulable as separate objects.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, most <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.LinkTemplate"/>s are implemented as
            <c>DataTemplate</c>s consisting of <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel"/>s.
            The principal child element of a <c>LinkPanel</c> is normally a <c>LinkShape</c>
            that has the <c>x:Name</c> of "Path"
            and that has the attached property <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel.IsLinkShapeProperty"/> set to true.
            The panel arranges the other child elements along the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>'s
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Link.Route"/> according to various attached properties.
            </para>
            <para>
            To make it easy to implement common arrowheads, you can set the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel.ToArrowProperty"/>
            and/or <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel.FromArrowProperty"/> attached properties on a <c>Path</c> element.

            <para>
            At the current time a <c>LinkPanel</c> or <c>LinkShape</c>/<c>Path</c>
            must be the root visual element of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Here is a simple <c>DataTemplate</c> for a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/> that has an arrowhead:
            <code>
              &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="ExampleLinkTemplate"&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkPanel go:Link.SelectionElementName="Path" go:Link.SelectionAdorned="True" &gt;
                  &lt;go:LinkShape x:Name="Path" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" /&gt;
                  &lt;Path Fill="Black" go:LinkPanel.ToArrow="Standard" /&gt;
                &lt;/go:LinkPanel&gt;
              &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            A <c>LinkPanel</c> may have multiple children (<c>LinkShape</c>
            for which <c>go:LinkPanel.IsLinkShape="True"</c>.
            One of them must be the primary link path, with the <c>x:Name</c> of "Path";
            this is what will be returned by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel.Path"/> property.
            All of rest will get the same route geometry as the primary <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkPanel.Path"/>.
            This makes it easy to implement gradient-like effects by using multiple link shapes
            of different colors:
            <code>
              &lt;go:LinkPanel . . .&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkShape StrokeThickness="7" Stroke="DarkBlue" /&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkShape StrokeThickness="5" Stroke="Blue" /&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkShape StrokeThickness="3" Stroke="LightBlue" /&gt;
                &lt;go:LinkShape x:Name="Path" StrokeThickness="1" Stroke="White" /&gt;
                . . .
              &lt;/go:LinkPanel&gt;
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            By default each LinkPanel sets <c>UseLayoutRounding</c> to false,
            except that it is set to true when used inside an <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Adornment"/>.

            This method can have the same effect as several calls to "OnMouse..." methods,
            without requiring the use of any <b>MouseEventArgs</b>, <b>MouseButtonEventArgs</b>,
            or <b>MouseWheelEventArgs</b>.
            For the mouse double click gestures, such as <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Gesture.MouseLeftDoubleClick"/>,
            this is equivalent to a mouse down, mouse up, mouse down, and a mouse up.
            For the mouse button gestures, such as <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Gesture.MouseLeftButton"/>,
            this is equivalent to a mouse down, two mouse moves if <paramref name="down"/>
            is different than <paramref name="up"/>, and a mouse up.
            For the mouse wheel gestures, such as <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Gesture.MouseWheelForward"/>,
            this is equivalent to a mouse wheel turn.
            </para>
            <para>
            In all cases the <b>Point</b>s are in model coordinates, not in FrameworkElement coordinates.
            The down and up points must be within the current <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.DiagramPanel.ViewportBounds"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            If you pass a different diagram as the <paramref name="other"/> argument instead of null,
            this simulates a drag-and-drop from this diagram to that other diagram.
            Even in WPF, the drag-and-drop will be simulated, rather than using real Windows drag-and-drop,
            as it would if it did not have permission.
            The various methods that take <b>DragEventArgs</b> are not called.
            Supplying a different diagram is not supported for wheel and double-click gestures.

            You can specify which layer a part should be in by setting its <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.LayerName"/> property.
            </para>

            A <c>Part</c> is typically created by the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/>'s <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.PartManager"/>

            The part manager creates the node or link, sets its <c>Content</c> property to the data (indirectly)
            and its <c>ContentTemplate</c> property to a <c>DataTemplate</c> based on the type of part and
            the part's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Category"/>.
            The <c>FrameworkElement</c> that results from the application of the template to the data

            Each part has a <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Bounds"/> property that describes its position and size in model coordinates.
            This property is read-only.
            One can change the bounds of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Node"/> by setting its
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Location"/> or <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Position"/> property.

            <para>
            Most of the properties pertinent to parts are attached dependency properties rather than regular
            dependency properties.
            Many are only to be used on the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>, not on the part itself nor on nested
            elements in the part's visual tree.
            The reason for using attached properties is to make it easier to data bind those properties
            in the data template.
            </para>
            <para>
            An example is the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.LayerNameProperty"/>.  Consider the following data template for nodes:
            <code>
              &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="ExampleTemplate"&gt;
                &lt;Border Background="White" BorderBrush="Blue" BorderThickness="2" CornerRadius="3" Padding="2,0,2,0"
                           go:Node.LayerName="{Binding Path=Data.LayerName}"&gt;
                  &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Name}" /&gt;
                &lt;/Border&gt;
              &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            </code>
            The example assumes that the node data to which each node is bound has at least two properties:
            one named "Name" holding the text to be displayed, and one named "LayerName" specifying the name
            of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer"/> that the node should be in.
            Note that setting the attribute for the layer name refers to the attached property qualified
            by the class name ("Node" in this case, in the XMLNS namespace referenced by "go").
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.LayerName"/> CLR property of <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/> gets and sets the value of the
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.LayerNameProperty"/> on the part's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>.
            Please be aware that such property getters will just return the default value for the property
            when the data template has not yet been applied, as will be the case when <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>
            is null.
            Such property setters will try applying the template if needed before actually setting
            the attached property on the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>.

            Note that the data binding goes indirectly through a property named "Data":
            <code>
              &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Name}" /&gt;
            </code>
            This is because the part's <c>Content</c> is not the data itself but a simple data structure
            that includes the data as its <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.PartManager.PartBinding.Data"/> property.
            The other property refers to the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Part"/> itself.  This permits bindings such as:
            <code>
              &lt;DataTrigger Binding="{Binding Path=Part.IsSelected}" Value="True" &gt;
                &lt;Setter Property="Border.BorderBrush" Value="Red" /&gt;
                &lt;Setter Property="go:Node.LayerName" Value="Foreground" /&gt;
              &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
            </code>
            This results in the border's brush changing color when the node is selected,
            and in the node being moved to the foreground layer when it is selected.
            (This requires corresponding changes to the <c>Border</c> element, since the
            <c>BorderBrush</c> and <c>go:Node.LayerName</c> properties should not be set
            locally if they want to be modified in a style trigger.)
            </para>
            <para>
            There are many properties, named "...able", that control what operations the user
            may perform on this part.  These properties correspond to the same named
            properties on <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/> and <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer"/> that govern the behavior
            for all parts in all layers or for all parts in the given layer.
            For example, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Copyable"/> property corresponds to the properties
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.AllowCopy"/> and
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Layer.AllowCopy"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            For each of these "ability" properties there is a corresponding "Can..." predicate.
            For example, the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.CanCopy"/> predicate is false if any of the three
            previously named properties is false.
            </para>
            <para>
            As previously mentioned, <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram"/> supports the notion of selected parts.
            The part class also supports showing visual objects for a part when it gets selected.
            These visuals are typically used to show that the part is selected ("selection handles")
            or are used to allow the user to manipulate or modify the part with a tool ("tool handles").
            These handles are the visual elements of <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Adornment"/> nodes.
            The <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.UpdateAdornments"/> method is responsible for showing or hiding adornments,
            normally depending on whether the part is selected.
            </para>
            <para>
            When the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.SelectionAdorned"/> (attached) property is true, a selected part
            automatically gets an <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Adornment"/> node created for it.
            Such a node gets a <c>ContentTemplate</c> property that is the value of
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.SelectionAdornmentTemplate"/>.
            (If the value is null, a default selection adornment template is used.)
            If the node is bound to data, the adornment is also bound to the same data.
            </para>
            <para>
            Tool handles are shown for those tools that need it.
            The process of updating adornments for a part will ask each mode-less tool
            to <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.IDiagramTool.UpdateAdornments(Northwoods.GoXam.Part)"/>.
            Most tools might not need special tool handles.  But, for example,
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.ResizingTool"/> naturally will want to
            create an adornment with eight resize handles positioned at the corners and
            at the middles of the sides of the selected node's visual element,
            if the node has <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.CanResize"/> returning true.
            </para>
            <para>
            However one does not always want the whole part to get the selection handle
            and any tool handles.  Sometimes one wants to emphasize selection by
            highlighting a particular element within the part's visual tree.
            This can be achieved by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.SelectionElementName"/> property,
            and making sure the desired element has the same <c>x:Name</c> attribute value.
            For example, the following node template causes resize handles to appear surrounding
            the <c>Rectangle</c> element, not around the whole node.
            <code>
              &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="ExampleTemplate"&gt;
                &lt;StackPanel go:Node.Resizable="True" go:Node.SelectionElementName="myIcon"&gt;
                  &lt;Rectangle x:Name="myIcon" Width="30" Height="30"
                             Fill="LightSalmon" Stroke="Maroon" StrokeThickness="2" /&gt;
                  &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Data.Name}" HorizontalAlignment="Center" /&gt;
                &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
              &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            There are some methods for finding and examining particular elements in the part's visual tree:
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.FindDescendant(System.Predicate{System.Windows.FrameworkElement})"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.FindNamedDescendant(System.String)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.IsVisibleElement(System.Windows.UIElement)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.GetRelativeElementPoint(System.Windows.FrameworkElement,Northwoods.GoXam.Spot)"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.GetElementPoint(System.Windows.FrameworkElement,Northwoods.GoXam.Spot)"/>, and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.GetElementBounds(System.Windows.FrameworkElement)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are other methods and properties for looking at the relationships between parts:
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.IsTopLevel"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.FindTopLevelPart"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.IsContainedBy(Northwoods.GoXam.Part)"/>,

            Each <c>Node</c> has a <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Location"/> property.
            By default this is the same as the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Bounds"/> X,Y position.
            However, you can set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Location"/> property,
            whereas <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Bounds"/> is a read-only property.
            </para>
            <para>
            Furthermore, the "location" need not be the same as the top-left point of the "bounds".
            Often there is a particular FrameworkElement in the node that is the featured element,
            and the "location" for the node is actually a point within that element.
            You can specify which element provides the node's location by setting the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LocationElementName"/> property.
            By default the element name is the empty string, meaning to use the visual element of the node.
            You can specify which point on that element is the actual location point
            by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LocationSpot"/> property.
            By default the location spot is <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.TopLeft"/>,
            meaning the top-left point of the location element.
            Therefore, the combination of the two default location-specifying properties
            result in the location of a node to be the top-left point of the bounds of the whole node,
            the same as the position of the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Bounds"/>.
            But it is moderately common to specify a particular shape or image as the location element name,
            and it is fairly common to use <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Spot.Center"/> as the location spot.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Location"/> property is a CLR property implemented
            using the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LocationProperty"/> attached dependency property
            on the node's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>.
            The reason that most of the node "properties" are implemented as attached dependency
            properties rather than regular CLR properties is that it allows for those property values to be data-bound.
            It is commonplace to specify the location using a data binding:
            <code>
            &lt;DataTemplate x:Key="MyNodeTemplate"&gt;
              &lt;Border ...
                    go:Node.Location="{Binding Path=Data.Location, Mode=TwoWay}"&gt;
                ...
              &lt;/Border&gt;
            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            </code>
            This data-binds the node's location with a property on the node data named "Location".
            Data binding not only keeps FrameworkElement properties in synch with data properties,
            but also helps support a model-view architecture and undo/redo.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.MinLocation"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.MaxLocation"/> properties help limit
            how far a node may be dragged.

            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.RotationAngle"/> property sets the angle of the node's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.SelectionElement"/>.

            <para>
            The most common relationship supported by nodes is a node-to-node link relationship.
            There are a number of properties that return collections of <c>Node</c>s that a given
            node is connected with, and there are a number of properties that return collections of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Link"/>s that a given node connects with to other nodes.
            These properties are:
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.NodesConnected"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.NodesInto"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.NodesOutOf"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinksConnected"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinksInto"/>, and <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinksOutOf"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Creating new links is achieved by adding or modifying data in the diagram's model.
            The precise methods depend on whether the model is an
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ILinksModel"/> or an <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.IConnectedModel"/> or an <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ITreeModel"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Nodes also support the ability to provide logical and physical distinctions in the
            connection points that links use at a node, if the diagram's model supports it.
            These connections points are called "ports".
            Some models assume that there is only one port per node.
            By default that will be the node's <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.VisualElement"/>.
            However, one can set the <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.PortIdProperty"/> attached property
            on any visual element to cause that FrameworkElement to be treated as a "port".
            In the case of a single port for a node, you should set the <c>PortId</c> as an empty string:
            <code>
              ...
                &lt;... ... go:Node.PortId="" ... &gt;
              ...
            </code>
            You can get the FrameworkElement that is the default (single) port using the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Port"/> property.
            </para>
            <para>
            When a node has multiple ports, i.e. multiple FrameworkElements acting as
            separate connection points for links, you should set each port's <c>PortId</c>
            to a string value that is unique for the node.
            When there may be multiple ports on a node, you can get a collection of FrameworkElements
            representing ports using the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.Ports"/> property.
            Use the <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.FindPort(System.String,System.Boolean)"/> method to find a particular port element by name.
            There are also methods for finding the collection of nodes or of links that are
            connected to a particular port element.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are also several attached properties that can be set to control how links
            connect to that FrameworkElement.  These include:
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.FromSpotProperty"/>, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.ToSpotProperty"/>,
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.FromEndSegmentLengthProperty"/>, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.ToEndSegmentLengthProperty"/>.
            There are also some attached properties that control whether users may
            create new links connecting to a port:
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinkableFromProperty"/>, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinkableToProperty"/>,
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinkableSelfNodeProperty"/>, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinkableDuplicatesProperty"/>,
            and <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.LinkableMaximumProperty"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Nodes also support the notion of group membership for models that implement
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Model.ISubGraphModel"/>.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.ContainingSubGraph"/> property returns the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Group"/> that
            a node is a member of, or null if there is no container group for that node.
            Changing the group membership of a node requires modifying the diagram's model.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <c>Node</c> class also supports the notion of expanding and collapsing a subtree
            starting at a given node.  There are two attached properties, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.IsTreeExpandedProperty"/>
            and <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.WasTreeExpandedProperty"/>, that can be data-bound, as well as two methods,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.CollapseTree"/> and <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Node.ExpandTree"/>.

            Angles start with zero being rightwards, in the direction of the positive X axis, and increase clockwise.

            It is the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.SelectionElement"/> that is rotated, not necessarily the whole node.
            Often one wants to rotate the principal element(s) of the node, but not the text or other decorations.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can enable user-controlled rotation of nodes by setting <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Part.Rotatable"/> to true.
            That makes use of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.RotatingTool"/>, which may set this dependency property.
            Therefore one-way data-bindings of this attached dependency property to updated source properties
            may not get updated values when this property has been set.

            You can change the value of this property by setting <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Route.Routing"/>.
            This property primarily controls the behavior of <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Route.ComputePoints"/>,
            to position the points of the stroke so that straight line segments will
            be horizontal or vertical.
            You can have a link drawn with only horizontal and vertical segments if the
            link's curve is <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkCurve.None"/>, <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkCurve.JumpOver"/>,

            If the curve is <see cref="F:Northwoods.GoXam.LinkCurve.Bezier"/>, some of the orthogonally
            positioned points act as control points to help form the curve.
            The orthogonal <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Route.ComputePoints"/> algorithm adds two segments to
            the normal three segments so that it is possible to connect two ports using only
            orthogonal lines.

            Values of this property typically fall in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.  
            A value of 0.0 indicates that the control points of the curve are at the end points, which will result in straight line segments.
            A value of 1.0 indicates that the control points are one-third of the link's length away from the end point along the direction of the link,
            and the same distance away in a perpendicular direction. The distance scales linearly with the value of this property,

            For example, you can change the selection policy in XAML by:
            <code>
              &lt;go:Diagram ...&gt;

              &lt;/go:Diagram&gt;
            </code>
            Or you can customize the default <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.DragSelectingTool"/> in code:
            <code>
              myDiagram.DragSelectingTool.Include = SearchInclusion.Intersects;

            If you want real-time selection to occur during the drag:
            <code>
             public class RealtimeDragSelectingTool : DragSelectingTool {

            and install in XAML by:

            If the result is <c>DragDropEffects.Move</c> and the data was moved
            to a different diagram, this will delete the original <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.DraggingTool.DraggedParts"/>.
            Otherwise (if the result was a copy) this will move the dragged parts back
            to their original locations.
            Finally this stops this tool.

            <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.MouseMoveTools"/>, or

            This <c>ToolManager</c> tool is normally the <see cref="P:Northwoods.GoXam.Diagram.DefaultTool"/>,

            When this tool is running as the current tool, it handles mouse-down,
            mouse-move, and mouse-up events.  For each event it iterates over each of the tools
            in the corresponding list, calling its <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.IDiagramTool.CanStart"/> predicate.
            If that predicate returns true, it starts that tool by making it the diagram's current tool.
            It then activates the tool and passes on the event to the tool by calling the
            corresponding method (either <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.IDiagramTool.DoMouseDown"/>,
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.IDiagramTool.DoMouseMove"/>, or <see cref="M:Northwoods.GoXam.Tool.IDiagramTool.DoMouseUp"/>).
